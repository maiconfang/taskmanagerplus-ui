			"description": "In the role of Quality Assurance, During my time at Velti Tecnologia (2014 - 2019), I played a pivotal role in ensuring the quality and performance of Time and Attendance Systems. One of my notable accomplishments was in performance testing, where I utilized tools like JUnit and JMeter to rigorously test the system's performance under different scenarios. This involved simulating various user loads to identify potential bottlenecks and areas for optimization. In addition to performance testing, I also conducted usability and functional tests using Selenium WebDriver. This allowed me to assess the user experience and ensure that the system's functionalities met the required specifications. To support these testing efforts, I created and maintained a comprehensive test repository. This included developing test suites and test cases that covered various aspects of the systems. I worked closely with the development team to understand the technical details and nuances, which helped me design effective testing strategies. My experience at Velti Tecnologia provided me with hands-on experience in identifying IT solutions through rigorous testing methodologies. Over the course of five years, I honed my ability to collaborate with cross-functional teams, analyze technical requirements, and provide recommendations based on testing outcomes. Through my work, I developed a deep understanding of the importance of aligning IT solutions with business objectives, ensuring that the technology not only functions correctly but also adds value to the client's operations.",
